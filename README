dns is an interactive program that lets you query the Domain Name System.
I wrote it to learn about the DNS.

BUILDING
--------

$ ant


USAGE
-----

$ java -jar dns nameserver-ip-address nameserver-port

Example:
$ java -jar dns 8.8.8.8 53


COMMANDS
--------

resolve (r) - resolves a host name to an IP address

  Usage:   resolve domain
  Example: resolve jonahb.com

  If no command is entered (i.e., just a domain name), the resolve command is 
  executed by default. Thus you may resolve jonahb.com with the command
  "r jonahb.com" or just "jonahb.com".

query (q) - performs a general lookup

  Usage:   query [options] domain [query-type [query-class]]
  Options: -nr non-recursive query
  Example: query -nr jonahb.com cname

  query-type may be a resource record type (e.g. A, CNAME, MX) or "*" or
  "All". query-class may be "Internet", "Hesiod", "CHAOS", "*", or "Any".  

  If either of query-type or query-class is not specified, the setting is used
  (see documentation for set command).

reverse (v) - performs a reverse lookup, finding the domain for an IP address

  Usage:   reverse ip-address
  Example: reverse 66.33.211.117

trace (t) - simulates an iterative resolution of a host name to an IP address
  by (1) finding the host's canonical name, if any; (2) printing the name
  server for each domain in the hierarchy; (3) printing the ip address of the
  host.

  Usage:   trace domain
  Example: trace jonahb.com

set (s) - changes settings

  Usage:  set [querytype | qt]  query-type
          set [queryclass | qc] query-class
          set [nameserver | ns] ip-address [port]

  The querytype and queryclass settings only apply to the query (q) command.
  The nameserver setting applies to all commands. If the port is not
  specified, the default DNS port (53) is used.

quit (exit) - quits the program

  Usage:  quit
